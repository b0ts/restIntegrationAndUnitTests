This is quick WIP to demonstrate how I use RESTAssured to perform integration end point testing.  
The src/test/java/com/sls/AgLocalRestTest.java shows how to test GET and POST calls simply.
The src/test/java/com/sls/AfWordReversTest.java shows how to do data driven unit testing via a simple ArrayList to test
happy path and edge conditions.  This can be used as a template for good unit testing design.
The src/test/java/MissingAltTest.java, shows how to use Selenium to test that all img tags have an associated alt tag.  
This is important for SEO and Web Accessibility Compliance.
